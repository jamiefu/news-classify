Welcome to MIT News Classify's documentation!
=============================================

MIT News Classify is a package containing several natural language processing (NLP) and ML-based models
that have been finetuned on the NYT Annotated Corpus and its predefined news tags.
It was developed in Summer 2020 as a tool for topic classification using NLP with the Tegmark Group at MIT. 
Some of its models have been integrated into the Tegmark Group's other projects, such as `Improve The News
<improvethenews.org>`_.
