That event, a biotech conference attended by 200 people in late February, is now well known as a source of Covid-19 spread very early on in the pandemic. Here is how a virus spreads Here is how a virus spreads 01:45 'Ultimately, more than 90 cases were diagnosed in people associated with this conference or their contacts, raising suspicion that a superspreading event had occurred there,' the researchers wrote in their study. Superspreading occurs when one or a few infected people cause a cascade of transmissions of an infectious disease. The new study -- which has not yet been peer-reviewed but was posted to the online server medrxiv.org on Tuesday -- involved analyzing the impact of early superspreading events in the Boston area and provided 'direct evidence' that superspreading can profoundly alter the course of an epidemic. 'An unfortunate perfect storm' The researchers -- from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge and other various institutions -- conducted genetic analyses of coronavirus specimen samples in Massachusetts. The researchers sequenced and analyzed 772 complete genomes of the virus from the region. They found 80 introductions of the virus into the Boston, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe, and 'hundreds of cases from major outbreaks' in various settings, including the conference. Coronavirus quickly spread around the world starting late last year, new genetic analysis shows Coronavirus quickly spread around the world starting late last year, new genetic analysis shows The conference, held from February 26 to 27, was a 'perfect storm' and the superspreading there could have been connected to approximately 20,000 cases, Bronwyn MacInnis, a researcher at the Broad Institute who worked on the study, told CNN in an email on Tuesday. 'Many factors made the conference an unfortunate perfect storm as a superspreading event. That the virus was introduced at the conference at all was unlucky,' MacInnis wrote in the email. 'This is not a rigorous estimate but does communicate the scale,' MacInnis added. 'If tens of thousands of individuals seems large, it is important to point out that it is in context of a pandemic that has infected tens of millions of people.' Unseen Covid-19 cases began early, spread fast Unseen Covid-19 cases began early, spread fast 03:00 Timing was crucial. In late February, people were not yet aware of the pandemic risk. 'When it happened was critical: it was scheduled just as we were collectively beginning to appreciate the imminent threat of COVID at home--if it had been a week later the event likely would have been cancelled,' MacInnis wrote in the email. 'Also, because it happened early in the epidemic it had the chance to spread widely before extensive testing capacity, shutdowns, social distancing, and masking were in place,' she wrote. 'The other critical factor was the population the virus landed in: people who had come from many different places (including some where COVID was already circulating), and who then returned home, often unknowingly bringing the virus with them.' 'A much greater understanding of how easily and quickly this virus can be transmitted' While the researchers did not identify the conference in their study, The Boston Globe on Tuesday said it was an international meeting of leaders from the biotechnology company Biogen at the Marriott Long Wharf hotel in Boston. How 53 members of this choir were infected in &#39;super spreader&#39; event How 53 members of this choir were infected in 'super spreader' event 03:03 'February 2020 was nearly a half year ago, and was a period when general knowledge about the coronavirus was limited,' Biogen said in a written statement to CNN on Tuesday. 'We were adhering closely to the prevailing official guidelines. We never would have knowingly put anyone at risk. When we learned a number of our colleagues were ill, we did not know the cause was COVID-19, but we immediately notified public health authorities and took steps to limit the spread.' The company noted in its statement that it joined a collaboration with the Broad Institute in April to share biological and medical data to advance knowledge around Covid-19. 'The world today has a much greater understanding of how easily and quickly this virus can be transmitted, and we are proud to contribute through this collaboration to the global effort to overcome COVID-19,' it said.

Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said in a news conference on Tuesday that he saw the Biogen conference in February as a 'seminal event' in the coronavirus pandemic for the Boston area. 'I was criticized actually for saying a few months ago that the Biogen event was a seminal event with respect to corona here in the Commonwealth and I couldn't put a number on it at that point in time,' Baker said. 'This is no offense to anybody, but at that point in time, nobody was wearing masks, nobody was social distancing, nobody was even behaving with concern about the presence of the virus at all. I mean all rules of the game with respect to that have changed,' Baker said. 'It speaks to the power of that virus to move from one person to another to another.'

The new pre-print study also investigated the spread of the coronavirus in other settings across the Boston area, including a skilled nursing facility -- where 85% of residents and 37% of staff tested positive -- and a homeless shelter -- where the coronavirus was introduced seven times, including four that resulted in clusters of cases, according to the study. 'Our findings repeatedly highlight the close relationships between seemingly disconnected groups and populations: viruses from international business travel seeded major outbreaks among individuals experiencing homelessness, spread throughout the Boston area, and were exported to other domestic and international sites,' the researchers wrote in the study.")

    >>> tfidf.getfeatures("A destructive storm is rising from warm waters. Again. America and the world are getting more frequent and bigger multibillion dollar tropical catastrophes like Hurricane Laura, which is menacing the U.S. Gulf Coast, because of a combination of increased coastal development, natural climate cycles, reductions in air pollution and man-made climate change, experts say. The list of recent whoppers keeps growing: Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, Michael, Dorian. And hurricane experts have no doubt that Laura will be right there with them. It’s a mess at least partially of our own making, said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Institute at the University of South Carolina. “We are seeing an increase of intensity of these phenomena because we as a society are fundamentally changing the Earth and at the same time we are moving to locations that are more hazardous,” Cutter said Wednesday. In the last three years, the United States has had seven hurricane disasters that each caused at least $1 billion in damage, totaling $335 billion. In all of the 1980s, there were six, and their damage totaled $38.2 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All those figures are adjusted for the cost of living. The Atlantic is increasingly spawning more major hurricanes, according to an Associated Press analysis of NOAA hurricane data since 1950. That designation refers to storms with at least 111-mile-per-hour (179-kilometer-per-hour) winds that are the ones that do the most damage. The Atlantic now averages three major hurricanes a year, based on a 30-year running average. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was two. The Atlantic’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy — a measurement that takes into account the number of storms, their strength and how long they last — is now 120 on a 30-year running average. Thirty years ago, it was in the 70s or 80s on average. Some people argue the increase is due to unchecked coastal development, while others will point to man-made climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. In fact, both are responsible, said former Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Craig Fugate. “There’s a lot of factors going on,” he said. When it comes to hurricane risk, a major factor is “the amount of stuff in the way of natural peril and the vulnerability of the stuff in the way,” said Mark Bove, a meteorologist who works for the insurance firm Munich Re U.S. One factor that increases the possibility that there will be “stuff in the way” of a major storm is that federal disaster policy and flood insurance subsidize and encourage people to rebuild in risky areas, Fugate said. After storms, communities “always say they are going to rise from the ashes,” and, too often, they build the same way in the same place for the same vulnerability and the same outcome, Fugate said. In addition, some places, like Houston, don’t limit development in areas that could serve as flood control zones if left empty and allow development that’s not disaster resilient, said Kathleen Tierney, former director of the Natural Hazards Center at Colorado University. Now add in the meteorology. Scientists agree that waters are warming, and that serves as hurricane fuel, said NOAA climate scientist Jim Kossin. A study by Kossin found that, once a storm formed, the chances of its attaining major storm status globally increased by 8% a decade since 1979. In the Atlantic, chances went up by 49% a decade. But scientists disagree on why waters are warming. They know climate change is a factor — but they say it’s not the biggest driver and disagree on what else may be behind it. Some argue it’s because of a 25- to 30-year natural global cycle that acts like a giant conveyor belt, carrying different levels of salt and temperature around the globe, including into the part of the tropical Atlantic off Africa where the worst hurricanes form, Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. When the water in the northern Atlantic is extra warm, the water in those tropical hurricane breeding grounds is unusually hot, and the hurricane season is abnormally active, Klotzbach said. Such a busy period started in 1995 and might end soon as northern Atlantic waters shift to a cooler regime, he said. Klotzbach acknowledged that one problem with this theory is that the waters in the northern Atlantic have been unusually cool this summer, and still there have been lots of storms. It may have been a blip, he said. But MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel says it’s because another counterintuitive factor is at play: There are more storms because of cleaner air. European air pollution cooled the area over Africa in the 1960s and 1970s and put more dust into the air — both of which tamped down on any hurricanes, he said. When the pollution eased, Africa got warmer, more storms developed, and that’s why it’s such a busy period, Emanuel said. While climate change is not the most important factor in warming waters, it contributes to creating more damaging storms in other ways, by causing a rising sea level that worsens storm surges and making storms move more slowly and produce more rain, scientists say. All of this means that we should get used to more catastrophic storms, according to Munich Re’s Bove. In addition, he said: “Climate change will be a bigger driver of losses in the future.”")
